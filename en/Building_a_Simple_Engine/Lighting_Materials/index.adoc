= Lighting & Materials: Basic lighting models and push constants

This chapter covers the implementation of basic lighting models and the use of push constants for material properties in Vulkan. Throughout our engine implementation, we use vk::raii dynamic rendering and C++20 modules to create a modern, efficient, and maintainable codebase.
