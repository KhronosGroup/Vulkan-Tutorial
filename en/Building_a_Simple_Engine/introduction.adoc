== Introduction

Welcome to the "Building a Simple Engine" tutorial series! This series marks a transition from the foundational Vulkan concepts covered in the previous chapters to a more structured approach focused on building a reusable rendering engine.

=== A New Learning Approach

While the previous tutorial series focused on introducing individual Vulkan concepts step by step, this series takes a different approach:

* *Intermediate to Advanced Level* - This tutorial assumes you have completed
 the original link:../00_Introduction.adoc[Vulkan Tutorial] series and are
 comfortable with the
 fundamental concepts. If this feels too advanced, start with the link:../00_Introduction.adoc[Vulkan Tutorial] and come back when you're ready.

* *Concept-Focused Learning* - Rather than providing exhaustive details on every possible implementation approach, we focus on key architectural concepts and design patterns for building a rendering engine.

* *More Independent Work* - This series will require more time and independent problem-solving from you. We'll provide the framework and guidance, but you'll need to fill in some details on your own. Remember that you have access to many resources: the https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/[Vulkan Guide] provides in-depth information on topics this tutorial only introduces, the https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/[Samples] offer hands-on demonstrations of specific implementations, and the https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/[Specification] contains the precise rules of the API. If you need assistance, don't hesitate to reach outâ€”Vulkan has a vibrant community with experts across a wide range of topics.

=== What to Expect

The "Building a Simple Engine" series is designed as a starting point for your journey into engine development, not a finishing point. We'll cover:

1. *Engine Architecture* - How to structure your code for flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility.

2. *Resource Management* - More sophisticated approaches to handling models, textures, and other assets.

3. *Rendering Techniques* - Implementation of modern rendering approaches within an engine framework.

4. *Performance Considerations* - How to design your engine with performance in mind.

5. *Publication Considerations* - How to prepare your application for distribution in a professional environment, including packaging, deployment, and platform-specific considerations.

Throughout this series, we encourage you to experiment, extend the provided examples, and even challenge some of our design decisions. The best way to learn engine development is by doing, and sometimes by making (and learning from) mistakes.

=== How to Use This Tutorial

Each chapter in this series builds upon the previous ones, gradually constructing a simple but functional rendering engine. We recommend:

1. Read through each chapter completely before implementing the code.
2. Take time to understand the concepts before moving on.
3. Don't hesitate to revisit the original Vulkan tutorial if you need to refresh your understanding of specific Vulkan concepts.
4. Experiment with the code and try to extend it with your own features.
