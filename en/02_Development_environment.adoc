= Development Environment

:pp: {plus}{plus}

In this chapter we'll set up your environment for developing Vulkan applications and install some useful libraries.
All of the tools we'll use, with the exception of the compiler, are compatible with Windows, Linux and MacOS, but the steps for installing them differ a bit, which is why they're described separately here.

== Windows

If you're developing for Windows, then I will assume that you are using Visual Studio to compile your code.
For complete C{pp}17 support, you need to use either Visual Studio 2017 or 2019.
The steps outlined below were written for VS 2017.

=== Vulkan SDK

The most important component you'll need for developing Vulkan applications is the SDK.
It includes the headers, standard validation layers, debugging tools and a loader for the Vulkan functions.
The loader looks up the functions in the driver at runtime, similarly to GLEW for OpenGL - if you're familiar with that.

The SDK can be downloaded from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/[the LunarG website] using the buttons at the bottom of the page.
You don't have to create an account, but it will give you access to some additional documentation that may be useful to you.

image::/images/vulkan_sdk_download_buttons.png[]

Proceed through the installation and pay attention to the install location of the SDK.
The first thing we'll do is verify that your graphics card and driver properly support Vulkan.
Go to the directory where you installed the SDK, open the `Bin` directory and run the `vkcube.exe` demo.
You should see the following:

image::/images/cube_demo.png[]

If you receive an error message then ensure that your drivers are up-to-date, include the Vulkan runtime and that your graphics card is supported.
See the xref:00_Introduction.adoc[introduction chapter] for links to drivers from the major vendors.

There is another program in this directory that will be useful for development.
The `glslangValidator.exe` and `glslc.exe` programs will be used to compile shaders from the human-readable https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.60.html[GLSL] to bytecode.
We'll cover this in depth in the xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/02_Graphics_pipeline_basics/01_Shader_modules.adoc[shader modules] chapter.
The `Bin` directory also contains the binaries of the Vulkan loader and the validation layers, while the `Lib` directory contains the libraries.

Lastly, there's the `Include` directory that contains the Vulkan headers.
Feel free to explore the other files, but we won't need them for this tutorial.

=== GLFW

As mentioned before, Vulkan by itself is a platform agnostic API and does not include tools for creating a window to display the rendered results.
To benefit from the cross-platform advantages of Vulkan and to avoid the horrors of Win32, we'll use the https://www.glfw.org/[GLFW library] to create a window, which supports Windows, Linux and MacOS.
There are other libraries available for this purpose, like https://www.libsdl.org/[SDL], but the advantage of GLFW is that it also abstracts away some of the other platform-specific things in Vulkan besides just window creation.

You can find the latest release of GLFW on the https://www.glfw.org/download.html[official website].
In this tutorial we'll be using the 64-bit binaries, but you can of course also choose to build in 32 bit mode.
In that case make sure to link with the Vulkan SDK binaries in the `Lib32` directory instead of `Lib`.
After downloading it, extract the archive to a convenient location.
I've chosen to create a `Libraries` directory in the Visual Studio directory under documents.

image::/images/glfw_directory.png[]

=== GLM

As a pure graphics api, Vulkan does not include a library for linear algebra operations, so we'll have to download one.
https://glm.g-truc.net/[GLM] is a nice library that is designed for use with graphics APIs and is also commonly used with OpenGL.

GLM is a header-only library, so just download the https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases[latest version] and store it in a convenient location.
You should have a directory structure similar to the following now:

image::/images/library_directory.png[]

=== Setting up Visual Studio

Now that you've installed all of the dependencies we can set up a basic Visual Studio project for Vulkan and write a little bit of code to make sure that everything works.

Start Visual Studio and create a new `Windows Desktop Wizard` project by entering a name and pressing `OK`.

image::/images/vs_new_cpp_project.png[]

Make sure that `Console Application (.exe)` is selected as application type so that we have a place to print debug messages to, and check `Empty Project` to prevent Visual Studio from adding boilerplate code.

image::/images/vs_application_settings.png[]

Press `OK` to create the project and add a C{pp} source file.
You should already know how to do that, but the steps are included here for completeness.

image::/images/vs_new_item.png[]

image::/images/vs_new_source_file.png[]

Now add the following code to the file.
Don't worry about trying to understand it right now;
we're just making sure that you can compile and run Vulkan applications.
We'll start from scratch in the next chapter.

[,c++]
----
#define GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

#define GLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE
#include <glm/vec4.hpp>
#include <glm/mat4x4.hpp>

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    glfwInit();

    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
    GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "Vulkan window", nullptr, nullptr);

    uint32_t extensionCount = 0;
    vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(nullptr, &extensionCount, nullptr);

    std::cout << extensionCount << " extensions supported\n";

    glm::mat4 matrix;
    glm::vec4 vec;
    auto test = matrix * vec;

    while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    glfwDestroyWindow(window);

    glfwTerminate();

    return 0;
}
----

Let's now configure the project to get rid of the errors.
Open the project properties dialog and ensure that `All Configurations` is selected, because most of the settings apply to both `Debug` and `Release` mode.

image::/images/vs_open_project_properties.png[]

image::/images/vs_all_configs.png[]

Go to `pass:c[C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories]` and press `+<Edit...>+` in the dropdown box.

image::/images/vs_cpp_general.png[]

Add the header directories for Vulkan, GLFW and GLM:

image::/images/vs_include_dirs.png[]

Next, open the editor for library directories under `+Linker -> General+`:

image::/images/vs_link_settings.png[]

And add the locations of the object files for Vulkan and GLFW:

image::/images/vs_link_dirs.png[]

Go to `+Linker -> Input+` and press `+<Edit...>+` in the `Additional Dependencies` dropdown box.

image::/images/vs_link_input.png[]

Enter the names of the Vulkan and GLFW object files:

image::/images/vs_dependencies.png[]

And finally change the compiler to support C{pp}17 features:

image::/images/vs_cpp17.png[]

You can now close the project properties dialog.
If you did everything right then you should no longer see any more errors being highlighted in the code.

Finally, ensure that you are actually compiling in 64 bit mode:

image::/images/vs_build_mode.png[]

Press `F5` to compile and run the project and you should see a command prompt and a window pop up like this:

image::/images/vs_test_window.png[]

The number of extensions should be non-zero.
Congratulations, you're all set for xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/00_Setup/00_Base_code.adoc[playing with Vulkan]!

== Linux

These instructions will be aimed at Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch Linux users, but you may be able to follow along by changing the package manager-specific commands to the ones that are appropriate for you.
You should have a compiler that supports C{pp}17 (GCC 7+ or Clang 5+).
You'll also need `make`.

=== Vulkan Packages

The most important components you'll need for developing Vulkan applications on Linux are the Vulkan loader, validation layers, and a couple of command-line utilities to test whether your machine is Vulkan-capable:

* `sudo apt install vulkan-tools` or `sudo dnf install vulkan-tools`: Command-line utilities, most importantly `vulkaninfo` and `vkcube`.
Run these to confirm your machine supports Vulkan.
* `sudo apt install libvulkan-dev` or `sudo dnf install vulkan-loader-devel` : Installs Vulkan loader.
The loader looks up the functions in the driver at runtime, similarly to GLEW for OpenGL - if you're familiar with that.
* `sudo apt install vulkan-validationlayers spirv-tools` or `sudo dnf install mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-validation-layers-devel`: Installs the standard validation layers and required SPIR-V tools. These are crucial when debugging Vulkan applications, and we'll discuss them in the upcoming chapter.

On Arch Linux, you can run `sudo pacman -S vulkan-devel` to install all the required tools above.

If installation was successful, you should be all set with the Vulkan portion.
Remember to run  `vkcube` and ensure you see the following pop up in a window:

image::/images/cube_demo_nowindow.png[]

If you receive an error message then ensure that your drivers are up-to-date, include the Vulkan runtime and that your graphics card is supported.
See the xref:00_Introduction.adoc[introduction chapter] for links to drivers from the major vendors.

=== X Window System and XFree86-VidModeExtension

It is possible that these libraries are not on the system, if not, you can install them using the following commands:

* `sudo apt install libxxf86vm-dev` or `dnf install libXxf86vm-devel`: Provides an interface to the XFree86-VidModeExtension.
* `sudo apt install libxi-dev` or `dnf install libXi-devel`: Provides an X Window System client interface to the XINPUT extension.

=== GLFW

As mentioned before, Vulkan by itself is a platform agnostic API and does not include tools for creation a window to display the rendered results.
To benefit from the cross-platform advantages of Vulkan and to avoid the horrors of X11, we'll use the https://www.glfw.org/[GLFW library] to create a window, which supports Windows, Linux and MacOS.
There are other libraries available for this purpose, like https://www.libsdl.org/[SDL], but the advantage of GLFW is that it also abstracts away some of the other platform-specific things in Vulkan besides just window creation.

We'll be installing GLFW from the following command:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
----

or

[,bash]
----
sudo dnf install glfw-devel
----

or

[,bash]
----
sudo pacman -S glfw
----

=== GLM

As a pure graphics api, Vulkan does not include a library for linear algebra operations, so we'll have to download one.
https://glm.g-truc.net/[GLM] is a nice library that is designed for use with graphics APIs and is also commonly used with OpenGL.

It is a header-only library that can be installed from the `libglm-dev` or `glm-devel` package:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install libglm-dev
----

or

[,bash]
----
sudo dnf install glm-devel
----

or

[,bash]
----
sudo pacman -S glm
----

=== Shader Compiler

We have just about all we need, except we'll want a program to compile shaders from the human-readable https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.60.html[GLSL] to bytecode.

Two popular shader compilers are Khronos Group's `glslangValidator` and Google's `glslc`.
The latter has a familiar GCC- and Clang-like usage, so we'll go with that: on Ubuntu, download Google's https://github.com/google/shaderc/blob/main/downloads.md[unofficial binaries] and copy `glslc` to your `/usr/local/bin`.
Note you may need to `sudo` depending on your permissions.
On Fedora use `sudo dnf install glslc`, while on Arch Linux run `sudo pacman -S shaderc`.
To test, run `glslc` and it should rightfully complain we didn't pass any shaders to compile:

`glslc: error: no input files`

We'll cover `glslc` in depth in the xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/02_Graphics_pipeline_basics/01_Shader_modules.adoc[shader modules] chapter.

=== Setting up a makefile project

Now that you have installed all of the dependencies, we can set up a basic makefile project for Vulkan and write a little bit of code to make sure that everything works.

Create a new directory at a convenient location with a name like `VulkanTest`.
Create a source file called `main.cpp` and insert the following code.
Don't worry about trying to understand it right now;
we're just making sure that you can compile and run Vulkan applications.
We'll start from scratch in the next chapter.

[,c++]
----
#define GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

#define GLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE
#include <glm/vec4.hpp>
#include <glm/mat4x4.hpp>

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    glfwInit();

    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
    GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "Vulkan window", nullptr, nullptr);

    uint32_t extensionCount = 0;
    vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(nullptr, &extensionCount, nullptr);

    std::cout << extensionCount << " extensions supported\n";

    glm::mat4 matrix;
    glm::vec4 vec;
    auto test = matrix * vec;

    while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    glfwDestroyWindow(window);

    glfwTerminate();

    return 0;
}
----

Next, we'll write a makefile to compile and run this basic Vulkan code.
Create a new empty file called `Makefile`.
I will assume that you already have some basic experience with makefiles, like how variables and rules work.
If not, you can get up to speed very quickly with https://makefiletutorial.com/[this tutorial].

We'll first define a couple of variables to simplify the remainder of the file.
Define a `CFLAGS` variable that will specify the basic compiler flags:

[,make]
----
CFLAGS = -std=c++17 -O2
----

We're going to use modern C{pp} (`pass:c[-std=c++17]`), and we'll set optimization level to O2.
We can remove -O2 to compile programs faster, but we should remember to place it back for release builds.

Similarly, define the linker flags in a `LDFLAGS` variable:

[,make]
----
LDFLAGS = -lglfw -lvulkan -ldl -lpthread -lX11 -lXxf86vm -lXrandr -lXi
----

The flag `-lglfw` is for GLFW, `-lvulkan` links with the Vulkan function loader and the remaining flags are low-level system libraries that GLFW needs.
The remaining flags are dependencies of GLFW itself: the threading and window management.

It is possible that the `Xxf86vm` and `Xi` libraries are not yet installed on your system.
You can find them in the following packages:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install libxxf86vm-dev libxi-dev
----

or

[,bash]
----
sudo dnf install libXi-devel libXxf86vm-devel
----

or

[,bash]
----
sudo pacman -S libxi libxxf86vm
----

Specifying the rule to compile `VulkanTest` is straightforward now.
Make sure to use tabs for indentation instead of spaces.

[,make]
----
VulkanTest: main.cpp
    g++ $(CFLAGS) -o VulkanTest main.cpp $(LDFLAGS)
----

Verify that this rule works by saving the makefile and running `make` in the directory with `main.cpp` and `Makefile`.
This should result in a `VulkanTest` executable.

We'll now define two more rules, `test` and `clean`, where the former will run the executable and the latter will remove a built executable:

[,make]
----
.PHONY: test clean

test: VulkanTest
    ./VulkanTest

clean:
    rm -f VulkanTest
----

Running `make test` should show the program running successfully, and displaying the number of Vulkan extensions.
The application should exit with the success return code (`0`) when you close the empty window.
You should now have a complete makefile that resembles the following:

[NOTE]
If you're on Wayland and the window does not show up: Don't worry. The Wayland compositor might only display a window when the application actually presents something. The window will start to show up on Wayland once we reach the first chapter where we actually present to the window.

[,make]
----
CFLAGS = -std=c++17 -O2
LDFLAGS = -lglfw -lvulkan -ldl -lpthread -lX11 -lXxf86vm -lXrandr -lXi

VulkanTest: main.cpp
  g++ $(CFLAGS) -o VulkanTest main.cpp $(LDFLAGS)

.PHONY: test clean

test: VulkanTest
  ./VulkanTest

clean:
  rm -f VulkanTest
----

You can now use this directory as a template for your Vulkan projects.
Make a copy, rename it to something like `HelloTriangle` and remove all of the code in `main.cpp`.

You are now all set for xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/00_Setup/00_Base_code.adoc[the real adventure].

== MacOS

These instructions will assume you are using Xcode and the https://brew.sh/[Homebrew package manager].
Also, keep in mind that you will need at least MacOS version 10.11, and your device needs to support the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(API)#Supported_GPUs[Metal API].

=== Vulkan SDK

The most important component you'll need for developing Vulkan applications is the SDK.
It includes the headers, standard validation layers, debugging tools and a loader for the Vulkan functions.
The loader looks up the functions in the driver at runtime, similarly to GLEW for OpenGL - if you're familiar with that.

The SDK can be downloaded from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/[the LunarG website] using the buttons at the bottom of the page.
You don't have to create an account, but it will give you access to some additional documentation that may be useful to you.

image::/images/vulkan_sdk_download_buttons.png[]

The SDK version for MacOS internally uses link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK[MoltenVK].
There is no native support for Vulkan on MacOS, so what MoltenVK does is actually act as a layer that translates Vulkan API calls to Apple's Metal graphics framework.
With this you can take advantage of debugging and performance benefits of Apple's Metal framework.

After downloading the installer for MacOS, double-click the installer and follow the prompts. Keep a note of the installation location during the "Installation Folder" step. You will need to reference it when creating your projects in Xcode.

image::/images/sdk_install_mac.png[]

**Note**: In this tutorial, `vulkansdk` will refer to the path where you intalled the VulkanSDK.

Within the `vulkansdk/Applications` folder you should have some executable files that will run a few demos using the SDK.
Run the `vkcube` executable and you will see the following:

image::/images/cube_demo_mac.png[]

=== GLFW

As mentioned before, Vulkan by itself is a platform agnostic API and does not include tools for creating a window to display the rendered results.
We'll use the https://www.glfw.org/[GLFW library] to create a window, which supports Windows, Linux and MacOS.
There are other libraries available for this purpose, like https://www.libsdl.org/[SDL], but the advantage of GLFW is that it also abstracts away some of the other platform-specific things in Vulkan besides just window creation.

To install GLFW on MacOS we will use the Homebrew package manager to get the `glfw` package:

[,bash]
----
brew install glfw
----

=== GLM

Vulkan does not include a library for linear algebra operations, so we'll have to download one.
https://glm.g-truc.net/[GLM] is a nice library that is designed for use with graphics APIs and is also commonly used with OpenGL.

It is a header-only library that can be installed from the `glm` package:

[,bash]
----
brew install glm
----

=== Setting up Xcode

Now that all the dependencies are installed we can set up a basic Xcode project for Vulkan.
Most of the instructions here are essentially a lot of "plumbing" so we can get all the dependencies linked to the project.
Also, keep in mind that during the following instructions whenever we mention the folder `vulkansdk` we are referring to the folder where you extracted the Vulkan SDK.

Start Xcode and create a new Xcode project.
On the window that will open select Application > Command Line Tool.

image::/images/xcode_new_project.png[]

Select `Next`, write a name for the project and for `Language` select `pass:c[C++]`.

image::/images/xcode_new_project_2.png[]

Press `Next` and the project should have been created.
Now, let's change the code in the generated `main.cpp` file to the following code:

[,c++]
----
#define GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

#define GLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE
#include <glm/vec4.hpp>
#include <glm/mat4x4.hpp>

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    glfwInit();

    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
    GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "Vulkan window", nullptr, nullptr);

    uint32_t extensionCount = 0;
    vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(nullptr, &extensionCount, nullptr);

    std::cout << extensionCount << " extensions supported\n";

    glm::mat4 matrix;
    glm::vec4 vec;
    auto test = matrix * vec;

    while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    glfwDestroyWindow(window);

    glfwTerminate();

    return 0;
}
----

Keep in mind you are not required to understand all this code is doing yet, we are just setting up some API calls to make sure everything is working.

Xcode should already be showing some errors such as libraries it cannot find.
We will now start configuring the project to get rid of those errors.

To do this, you will need the install location of glfw and glm. The default homebrew folder varies if you are on an Intel Mac `/usr/local` or Apple Silicon Mac `/opt/homebrew`. You can determine your homebrew install location using `--prefix`:

[,bash]
----
brew --prefix
----

On the _Project Navigator_ panel select your project.
Open the _Build Settings_ tab and then:

* Find the *Header Search Paths* field.
- Add a link to `/opt/homebrew/include` (or `/usr/local/include` for Intel Mac). The glm and glfw3 header files should be in this directory.
- Add a link to `vulkansdk/macOS/include` for the Vulkan headers.
* Find the *Library Search Paths* field. 
- Add a link to `/opt/homebrew/lib` (again, `/usr/local/lib` for Intel Mac)
- Add a link to `vulkansdk/macOS/lib`.

It should look like so (obviously, paths will be different depending on where you placed on your files):

image::/images/xcode_paths.png[]

Now, in the _Build Phases_ tab, on *Link Binary With Libraries* we will add both the `glfw3` and the `vulkan` frameworks.
To make things easier we will be adding the dynamic libraries in the project (you can check the documentation of these libraries if you want to use the static frameworks).

* For glfw open the folder `/opt/homebrew/lib` and there you will find a file name like `libglfw.3.x.dylib` ("x" is the library's version number, it might be different depending on when you downloaded the package from Homebrew).
Simply drag that file to the Link Binary With Libraries section on Xcode.
* For vulkan, go to `vulkansdk/macOS/lib`.
Once open in Finder, look for `libvulkan.1.dylib` and `libvulkan.1.x.xxx.dylib` (where "x" will be the version number of the the SDK you downloaded). Select both files and drag them together into the Link Binary With Libraries section as well.

*Note:* If you drag the vulkan files in separately, the dynamic libraries may be incorrectly associated at runtime.

After adding those libraries, in the same tab on *Copy Files* change `Destination` to "Frameworks", clear the subpath and deselect "Copy only when installing".
Click on the "+" sign and add all those three frameworks here aswell.

Your Xcode configuration should look like:

image::/images/xcode_frameworks.png[]

The last thing you need to setup are a couple of environment variables.
On Xcode toolbar go to `Product` > `Scheme` > `+Edit Scheme...+`, and in the `Arguments` tab add the two following environment variables:

* VK_ICD_FILENAMES = `vulkansdk/macOS/share/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json`
* VK_LAYER_PATH = `vulkansdk/macOS/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d`

Uncheck 'shared'. It should look like so:

image::/images/xcode_variables.png[]

Finally, you should be all set!
Now if you run the project (remembering to setting the build configuration to Debug or Release depending on the configuration you chose) you should see the following:

image::/images/xcode_output.png[]

The number of extensions should be non-zero.
The other logs are from the libraries, you might get different messages from those depending on your configuration.

You are now all set for xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/00_Setup/00_Base_code.adoc[the real thing].
