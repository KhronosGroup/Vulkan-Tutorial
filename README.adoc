== Attribution

The Khronos Vulkan^®^ Tutorial is based on the "link:https://vulkan-tutorial.com/[Vulkan Tutorial]" by Alexander Overvoorde licensed under link:https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/[CC BY-SA 4.0].

== About

This repository hosts the contents of the link:https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest[Khronos Vulkan Tutorial]. The tutorial is part of the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Site[Vulkan Documentation Project].

== Differences

Compared to the original tutorial, this version of the tutorial is teaching up-to-date concepts:

* Vulkan 1.4 as a baseline
* Dynamic rendering instead of render passes
* Timeline semaphores
* link:https://shader-slang.org/[Slang] as the primary shading language
* Modern C++ (20) with modules
* link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp[Vulkan-Hpp] with link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization[RAII]

It also contains Vulkan usage clarifications, improved synchronization and new content.

== Project Structure

The repository is organized into several important directories:

* `en/` - Contains the tutorial content in English, organized by chapters
* `attachments/` - Contains code examples, shader files, and resources used in the tutorial
* `images/` - Contains illustrations, diagrams, and screenshots used in the tutorial
* `scripts/` - Contains utility scripts, including dependency installation scripts
* `antora/` - Contains configuration files for the Antora documentation system

== Installation Dependencies

The project provides scripts to help you install the necessary dependencies:

=== Linux
Run the following command to install dependencies on Linux:
[source,bash]
----
./scripts/install_dependencies_linux.sh
----

This script detects your package manager (apt, dnf, pacman) and installs the required dependencies, including:
* Build essentials (gcc, cmake, ninja-build)
* GLFW, GLM, tinyobjloader, stb
* X Window System dependencies

It also provides instructions for installing the Vulkan SDK.

=== Windows
Run the following command to install dependencies on Windows:
[source,batch]
----
scripts\install_dependencies_windows.bat
----

This script uses vcpkg to install the required dependencies, including:
* GLFW, GLM, tinyobjloader, stb

You will also need to install the Vulkan SDK separately from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/.

== Generating the Site Locally

This tutorial's site is generated using link:https://antora.org/[Antora],
a multi-repository documentation site generator. If you want to generate the
site locally then:

. Install link:https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[npm] and  optionally install
`Antora` (you can use `npx` instead)

. Assuming you are in the repository's root directory, fetch the Khronos
Antora UI bundle and build it:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/antora-ui-khronos.git
cd antora-ui-khronos/
npx update-browserslist-db@latest
./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js bundle
----
+
. Copy the generated UI bundle into the repository's root directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ../
cp ./antora-ui-khronos/build/ui-bundle.zip ./
----
+
. Then configure the Khronos Vulkan Samples Antora tree:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd antora/
make
----
+
. And navigate back to the repository's root folder and run:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ../
antora antora-ci-playbook.yml --stacktrace
----
+
Or in case you don't have antora installed, you can also:
+
[source,bash]
----
npx antora antora-ci-playbook.yml --stacktrace
----
+
. The generated site's index HTML should be accessible at: build/site/index.html
