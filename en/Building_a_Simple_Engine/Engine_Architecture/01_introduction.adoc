= Engine Architecture: Introduction

== Introduction

Welcome to the "Engine Architecture" chapter of our "Building a Simple Game
Engine" series! In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental architectural
patterns and design principles that form the backbone of a modern Vulkan
rendering engine.

While this series focuses primarily on building a rendering engine with Vulkan,
the architectural concepts we'll discuss are applicable to both rendering engines
and full game engines. We'll clarify which patterns are particularly well-suited
for rendering-focused systems versus more general game engine development.

We'll start by taking a step back and considering the overall structure of our engine. A
well-designed architecture is crucial for creating a flexible, maintainable, and extensible rendering system.

=== What You'll Learn

This chapter will take you through the foundational concepts that underpin effective engine design. We'll begin by exploring architectural patterns—the proven design approaches that game and rendering engines rely on to manage complexity and enable extensibility. Understanding these patterns helps you choose the right structural approach for different engine subsystems.

From there, we'll dive into component systems, which provide the flexibility to build modular, reusable code. You'll see how component-based architecture allows different parts of your engine to work together while remaining loosely coupled, making your codebase easier to maintain and extend.

Resource management forms another crucial pillar of engine architecture. We'll examine strategies for efficiently handling textures, models, shaders, and other assets, ensuring your engine can scale from simple scenes to complex, asset-heavy applications without performance bottlenecks.

The rendering pipeline design we'll cover shows you how to create a flexible system that can accommodate various rendering techniques and effects. This foundation will serve you well as you add more advanced rendering features in later chapters.

Finally, we'll implement event systems that enable clean communication between different engine components. This event-driven approach reduces tight coupling and makes your engine more maintainable as it grows in complexity.

=== Prerequisites

This chapter builds directly on the foundation established in the main Vulkan tutorial series, so completing that series is essential. The architectural concepts we'll discuss assume you're comfortable with Vulkan's core rendering concepts and have hands-on experience implementing them.

Beyond Vulkan knowledge, you'll benefit from familiarity with object-oriented programming principles, as modern engine architecture relies heavily on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to manage complexity. Experience with common design patterns like Observer, Factory, and Singleton will help you recognize when and why we apply these patterns in our engine design.

Modern C++ features play a crucial role in our implementation approach. Smart pointers help us manage resource lifetimes safely, templates enable flexible, reusable components, and other C++11/14/17 features allow us to write more expressive and maintainable code. If you're not comfortable with these concepts, consider reviewing them before proceeding.

You should also be familiar with the following chapters from the main tutorial:

** xref:../../03_Drawing_a_triangle/02_Graphics_pipeline_basics/00_Introduction.adoc[Graphics pipelines]
* xref:../../04_Vertex_buffers/00_Vertex_input_description.adoc[Vertex] and xref:../../04_Vertex_buffers/03_Index_buffer.adoc[index buffers]
* xref:../../05_Uniform_buffers/00_Descriptor_set_layout_and_buffer.adoc[Uniform buffers]

=== Why Architecture Matters

The difference between a hastily assembled renderer and a well-architected engine becomes apparent as soon as you need to make changes or add features. Good architecture creates a foundation that supports your development process rather than fighting against it.

Maintainability emerges from clean separation of concerns—when each component has a clear, focused responsibility, you can update or fix individual pieces without worrying about cascading effects throughout the system. This becomes invaluable when debugging graphics issues or implementing new rendering techniques.

Extensibility flows naturally from modular design. When your architecture provides clear extension points and interfaces, adding new features becomes a matter of implementing new components rather than rewriting existing systems. This allows your engine to evolve with your project's needs.

Reusability multiplies your development effort. Well-encapsulated components can move between projects or serve different purposes within the same project. A thoughtfully designed material system, for example, might work equally well for both game objects and UI elements.

Performance opportunities often emerge from architectural decisions made early in development. Good architecture enables optimizations like multithreading (by avoiding tight coupling between systems), batching (through predictable interfaces), and caching (via clear data flow patterns). While premature optimization is dangerous, premature architecture decisions can make later optimization impossible.

Let's begin our exploration of engine architecture with an overview of common architectural patterns used in modern rendering engines.
