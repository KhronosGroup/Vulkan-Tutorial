= Development Environment

:pp: {plus}{plus}

In this chapter, we'll set up your environment for developing Vulkan
applications and install some useful libraries. All the tools we'll use,
except for the compiler, are compatible with Windows, Linux and macOS, but the
steps for installing them differ a bit, which is why they're described
separately here.

== Dependency Install Scripts

To make the setup process easier, we've provided dependency install scripts for Windows and Linux:

=== Windows

For Windows, we provide a script that uses vcpkg to install all the required dependencies:

1. Make sure you have vcpkg installed. If not, follow the instructions at https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
2. Run the `scripts/install_dependencies_windows.bat` script
3. Follow the instructions to install the Vulkan SDK

While we are using vcpkg to enable this install script; the entire
process is outlined below in detail and can be achieved without using the
install script or needing vcpkg.  That's just a convenience to make the setup
 process easier.

=== Linux

For Linux, we provide a script that detects your package manager and installs all the required dependencies:

1. Run the `scripts/install_dependencies_linux.sh` script
2. Follow the instructions to install the Vulkan SDK

If you prefer to install the dependencies manually, or if you're using macOS, follow the platform-specific instructions below.

== Common considerations

=== Vulkan SDK

The most important part you'll need for developing Vulkan applications is the SDK.
It includes headers, standard validation layers, debugging tools and a loader for the Vulkan functions.
The loader looks up the functions in the driver at runtime, similarly to GLEW for OpenGL—if you're familiar with that.

The SDK can be downloaded from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/[the LunarG website] using the buttons at the bottom of the page.
You don't have to create an account, but it will give you access to some additional documentation that may be useful to you.

image::/images/vulkan_sdk_download_buttons.png[]

Proceed through the installation and pay attention to the installation location of the SDK.
The first thing we'll do is verify that your graphics card and driver properly support Vulkan.
Go to the directory where you installed the SDK, open the `bin` directory and
 run the `vkcube` demo.

There is another program in this directory that will be useful for
development. The `glslangValidator` and `glslc` programs will be
used to compile shaders from the human-readable
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language[GLSL] to bytecode.
We'll cover this in depth in the
xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/02_Graphics_pipeline_basics/01_Shader_modules.adoc[shader modules]
 chapter. The `bin` directory also contains the binaries of
the Vulkan loader and the validation layers, while the `lib` directory
contains the libraries.

Lastly, there's the `include` directory that contains the Vulkan headers.
Feel free to explore the other files, but we won't need them for this tutorial.

To automatically set the environment variables up that VulkanSDK will use to
make life easier with the CMake project configuration and various other
tooling, We recommend using the `setup-env` script. This can be added to
your auto-start for your terminal and IDE setup such that those environment
variables work everywhere.

If you receive an error message, then ensure that your drivers are up to date,
include the Vulkan runtime and that your graphics card is supported. See the 
xref:00_Introduction.adoc[introduction chapter] for links to drivers from the major
vendors.

=== CMake
For all the warts of working in cross-platform projects, CMake has become an
industry-wide staple. It allows developers to create a project wide build
description file which takes care of setting up and configuring all the
support tools required to create any project.
Other build systems that achieve similar capabilities exist such as bazel,
however, none are as widely used and accepted as CMake is.
A full description of how to use CMake is beyond the scope of this tutorial,
however, further details can be found at http://www.cmake.org[CMake]

Vulkan SDK has support for using find_package. To use it with your project,
you can add the search path for the *-config.cmake to the `HINTS` portion of
the find_package config calls: i.e.
[,cmake]
----
find_package(Slang CONFIG HINTS "$ENV{VULKAN_SDK}/lib/cmake").
----

In the future, FindVulkan.cmake might migrate to the *-config.cmake standard,
however at the time of writing it is recommended to grab FindVulkan.cmake
from VulkanSamples, as the one from Kitware is both deprecated and has bugs
in the macOS build. You will find it in the code directory link:/attachments/CMake/FindVulkan.cmake[FindVulkan.cmake].

Using FindVulkan.cmake is a project-specific file, you can take it and make
changes as necessary to work well in your build environment, and can craft
it further to your needs.  The one Khronos distributes in VulkanSamples is
well tested and is a good starting point.

To use it, add it to your CMAKE_MODULE_PATH like this:
[,cmake]
----
`list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/CMake")`
----

This will allow other projects that distribute via Find*.cmake to be placed
in that same folder. See the accompanying link:/attachments/CMakeLists.txt[CMakeLists.txt]
for an example of a working project.

Vulkan has support for C{pp} modules which became available with c{pp}20. A
large advantage of C{pp} modules is they give all the benefits of C{pp} without
the overhead long compile times. To do this, the .cppm file must be compiled
for your target device. This tutorial serves as an example of taking
advantage of C{pp} modules. The CMakeLists.txt in our tutorial has all the
instructions needed for building the module automatically:

[,cmake]
----
find_package (Vulkan REQUIRED)

# set up Vulkan C++ module
add_library(VulkanCppModule)
add_library(Vulkan::cppm ALIAS VulkanCppModule)

target_compile_definitions(VulkanCppModule
        PUBLIC VULKAN_HPP_DISPATCH_LOADER_DYNAMIC=1
)
target_include_directories(VulkanCppModule
        PRIVATE
        "${Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIR}"
)
target_link_libraries(VulkanCppModule
        PUBLIC
        Vulkan::Vulkan
)

set_target_properties(VulkanCppModule PROPERTIES CXX_STANDARD 20)

target_sources(VulkanCppModule
        PUBLIC
        FILE_SET cxx_modules TYPE CXX_MODULES
        BASE_DIRS
        "${Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIR}"
        FILES
        "${Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIR}/vulkan/vulkan.cppm"
)
----

The VulkanCppModule target only needs to be defined once, then add it to the
dependency of your consuming project, and it will be built automatically, and
you won't need to also add Vulkan::Vulkan to your project.

[,cmake]
----
target_link_libraries (${PROJECT_NAME} Vulkan::cppm)
----

That is all that is required to add Vulkan to any project.

=== Window Management

As mentioned before, Vulkan by itself is a platform-agnostic API and does not
include tools for creating a window to display the rendered results. To benefit
from the cross-platform advantages of Vulkan, we'll use the
http://www.glfw.org/[GLFW library] to create a window, which supports Windows, Linux and
 macOS. There are other libraries available for this purpose, like
https://www.libsdl.org/[SDL], but the advantage of GLFW is that
it also abstracts away some of the other platform-specific things in Vulkan
besides just window creation.

An unfortunate disadvantage is GLFW doesn't work in Android or iOS; it is a
desktop-only solution. SDL does offer mobile support; however, mobile
windowing support is best done by interfacing with the Operating system such
 as using the JNI in Android.

While mobile is beyond the scope of this initial tutorial, plans exist to
eventually cover it in detail, and
https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/graphics/getting-started[Google has excellent documentation].

=== GLM

Unlike DirectX 12, Vulkan does not include a library for linear algebra
operations, so we'll have to download one. http://glm.g-truc.net/[GLM] is a
nice library that is designed for use with graphics APIs and is also commonly
used with OpenGL.

=== Texturing library

Vulkan by itself has no support for reading various texture resources such
as png, jpeg, or ktx files. However, as this is a large topic, it is beyond
the scope of this tutorial to fully dive into all the various formats.  For
this tutorial, we will use stb as a dependency for loading up textures.  We
do recommend investigating ktx to gain full advantage of a texture format
that is designed for graphics applications in mind.

=== Modeling library

Model formats are numerous and expose a lot of details everywhere. In
general, with Vulkan and other graphical APIs, the most important things to
know are vertex information, texture coordinates, and potentially diffuse
color details.  GLTF is an advanced feature-full model format with
easy-to-support features available in a cross-platform library.  However, for this
tutorial, we're going to use tinyobjloader for its pure simplicity.  We
recommend tinyobjlader library only for small not complex projects.

== Windows

Development in Windows is easiest with Visual Studio. CLion works well with
Windows as does Android Studio, however, Visual Studio is very popular and
well-supported, so we'll discuss getting dependencies there. For complete
C++20 support, you need to use any version greater than 2019. The steps
outlined below were written for VS 2022.

=== Package management
For all platforms, we recommend using a platform management tool. Windows
natively doesn't depend upon package management, so this is a foreign concept.
However, Microsoft has introduced a fantastic package management tool which
does work cross-platform.  VCPkg also includes setting up all required CMake
settings.  We recommend  following the excellent documentation
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-powershell[here]
for details on how to use CMake in Windows projects.

This setup allows Windows developers to natively work in Visual Studio using
 CMake, and the integration is rather quite good.
Alternatively, http://jetbrains.com[CLion] natively supports CMakeLists.txt
projects on all platforms and works/functions exactly like Android Studio.
It is also a free IDE.

=== GLFW

We recommend using vcpkg as mentioned before to install packages, to do that,
run this from the command line: `vcpkg install glfw3`

If you desire to install without vcpkg, you can find the latest release of
GLFW on the https://www.glfw.org/download.html[official website].

In this tutorial, we'll be using the 64-bit binaries, but you can of course also
choose to build in 32-bit mode. In that case make sure to link with the Vulkan
SDK binaries in the `Lib32` directory instead of `Lib`. After downloading it, extract the archive
to a convenient location. I've chosen to create a `Libraries` directory in the
Visual Studio directory under documents.

image::/images/glfw_directory.png[]

=== GLM

As a pure graphics api, Vulkan does not include a library for linear algebra operations, so we'll have to download one.
LM can also be installed with vcpkg like so: vcpkg install glm

Alternatively, GLM is a header-only library, so download the https://glm.g-truc.net/[GLM]
which is designed for use with graphics APIs and is also commonly used with OpenGL.

image::/images/library_directory.png[]

=== tinyobjloader

Tinyobjloader can be installed with vcpkg like so: vcpkg install tinyobjloader

=== Setting up Visual Studio

==== Setting up a CMake project

Now that you have installed all the dependencies, we can set up a basic
CMake project for Vulkan and write a little bit of code to make sure that
everything works.

I will assume that you already have some basic experience with CMake, like
how variables and rules work. If not, you can get up to speed very quickly with https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/cmake/Help/guide/tutorial/[this tutorial].

You can now use the link:/attachments/[attachments] directory in this tutorial
as a template for your Vulkan projects. Make a copy, rename it to something like `HelloTriangle`
and remove all the code in `main.cpp`.

Congratulations, you're all set for xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/00_Setup/00_Base_code.adoc[playing with Vulkan]!

== Linux

These instructions will be aimed at Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch Linux users, but
 you may be able to follow along by changing the package manager-specific
 commands to the ones that are appropriate for you.
You should have a compiler that supports C{pp}20 (GCC 7+ or Clang 5+).
You'll also need You'll also need `cmake`. Most of this can be installed via
 larger packages such as build-essentials.

We recommend using CLion or another IDE; however, as with most things in Linux, GUIs are entirely optional.

=== Vulkan tarball

The most important parts you'll need for developing Vulkan applications on
Linux are the Vulkan loader, validation layers, and a couple of command-line
utilities to test whether your machine is Vulkan-capable:

Download the VulkanSDK tarball from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/[LunarG].
Place the uncompressed VulkanSDK in a convenient path, and create a symbolic
link to the latest on like so:

[,shell]
----
pushd vulkansdk
tar -xzf vulkansdk-linux-x86_64-1.4.304.1.tgz
ln -s 1.4.304.1 default
----

Then add the following to your ~/.bashrc file so Vulkan's environment
variables are enabled everywhere:

[,shell]
----
source ~/vulkanSDK/default/setup-env.sh
----

If installation  was successful, you should be all set with the Vulkan  portion.
Remember to run  `vkcube` and ensure you see the following pop up in a window:

image::/images/cube_demo_nowindow.png[]

If you receive an error message, then ensure that your drivers are up to date, include the Vulkan runtime and that your graphics card is supported.
See the xref:00_Introduction.adoc[introduction chapter] for links to drivers from the major vendors.

=== Ninja
Ninja is a rapid build system that CMake has support for in all
platforms.  We recommend installing it with `sudo apt install ninja`

=== X Window System and XFree86-VidModeExtension
It is possible that these libraries are not on the system, if not, you can
install them using the following commands:
* `sudo apt install libxxf86vm-dev` or `dnf install libXxf86vm-devel`:
Provides an interface to the XFree86-VidModeExtension.
* `sudo apt install libxi-dev` or `dnf install libXi-devel`: Provides an X
Window System client interface to the XINPUT extension.

=== GLFW

We'll be installing GLFW from the following command:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
----
or
[,bash]
----
sudo dnf install glfw-devel
----
or
[,bash]
----
sudo pacman -S glfw-wayland # glfw-x11 for X11 users
----

=== GLM

It is a header-only library that can be installed from the `libglm-dev` or
`glm-devel` package:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install libglm-dev
----
or
[,bash]
----
sudo dnf install glm-devel
----
or
[,bash]
----
sudo pacman -S glm
----

=== Setting up CLion (optional)

You can get http://jetbrains.com[CLion] from there.  We recommend installing
from the jetbrains toolbox so it can keep CLion up to date automatically.  To
 use an IDE like CLion, we have to setup the environment variables that are
 otherwise setup by when the terminal executes
[,shell]
----
source ~/vulkanSDK/default/setup-env.sh
----
To do that, open Settings, then select "Build, Execution, Deployment" and
then select CMake. At the bottom of that window will be the environment
variable, Just, add VULKAN_SDK=<fullPathToVulkanSDK> there and Vulkan will be
found during compile time.  As a convenience, for runtime at least, we
recommend placing the layers system wide.  To do that, from the terminal do
this:
[,bash]
----
sudo cp $VULKAN_SDK/lib/libVkLayer_*.so /usr/local/lib/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
sudo cp $VULKAN_SDK/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d/VkLayer_*.json /usr/local/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
----

Alternatively, you could add VK_LAYER_PATH to your system environment
variables, and point it to `$VULKAN_SDK/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d` Also,
you'd want to add to LD_LIBRARY_CONFIG the `$VULKAN_SDK/lib` path.  This is
all done for you by the setup-env.sh file when using the terminal.

=== Setting up a CMake project

Now that you have installed all the dependencies, we can set up a basic
CMake project for Vulkan and write a little bit of code to make sure that
everything works.

I will assume that you already have some basic experience with CMake, like
how variables and rules work. If not, you can get up to speed very quickly with https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/cmake/Help/guide/tutorial/[this tutorial].

You can now use the link:/attachments/[attachments] directory in this tutorial as a template for your
Vulkan projects. Make a copy, rename it to something like `HelloTriangle`
and remove all the code in `main.cpp`.

You are now all set for xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/00_Setup/00_Base_code.adoc[the real adventure].

== macOS

These instructions will assume you are using Xcode and the https://brew.sh/[Homebrew package manager].
Also, keep in mind that you will need at least macOS version 10.11, and your device needs to support the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(API)#Supported_GPUs[Metal API].

=== Vulkan SDK

The SDK version for macOS internally uses https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK[MoltenVK].
There is no native support for Vulkan on macOS, so what MoltenVK does is actually act as a layer that translates Vulkan API calls to Apple's Metal graphics framework.
With this, you can take advantage of the debugging and performance benefits of Apple's Metal framework.

After downloading the installer for macOS, double-click the installer and follow the prompts. Keep a note of the installation location during the "Installation Folder" step. You will need to reference it when creating your projects in Xcode.

image::/images/sdk_install_mac.png[]

**Note**: In this tutorial, `vulkansdk` will refer to the path where you installed the VulkanSDK.

Within the `vulkansdk/Applications` folder you should have some executable files that will run a few demos using the SDK.
Run the `vkcube` executable and you will see the following:

image::/images/cube_demo_mac.png[]

=== GLFW

To install GLFW on MacOS we will use the Homebrew package manager to get the `glfw` package:

[,bash]
----
brew install glfw
----

=== GLM

It is a header-only library that can be installed from the `glm` package:

[,bash]
----
brew install glm
----

=== Setting up Xcode

Now that all the dependencies are installed, we can set up a basic Xcode project for Vulkan.
Most of the instructions here are essentially a lot of "plumbing," so we can get all the dependencies linked to the project.
Also, keep in mind that during the following instructions whenever we mention the folder `vulkansdk` we are referring to the folder where you extracted the Vulkan SDK.

We recommend using CMake everywhere, and Apple is no different. An example
of how to use CMake for Apple can be found https://medium.com/practical-coding/migrating-to-cmake-in-c-and-getting-it-working-with-xcode-50b7bb80ae3d[here]
We also have documentation for using a cmake project in Apple environments
at the VulkanSamples project.  It targets both iOS and Desktop Apple.

Once you use CMake with the XCode generator, open the resulting xcode
project. If you use the code directory of this tutorial, you can do this
from the command line:

[,shell]
----
cd code
cmake -G XCode
----

The last thing you need to set up is a couple of environment variables.
On Xcode toolbar go to `Product` > `Scheme` > `+Edit Scheme...+`, and in the `Arguments` tab add the two following environment variables:

* VK_ICD_FILENAMES = `vulkansdk/macOS/share/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json`
* VK_LAYER_PATH = `vulkansdk/macOS/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d`

Uncheck 'shared'. It should look like so:

image::/images/xcode_variables.png[]

Finally, you should be all set!

You are now all set for xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/00_Setup/00_Base_code.adoc[the real thing].
