= Overview

This chapter will start off with an introduction of Vulkan and the problems
it addresses. After that, we're going to look at the ingredients that are
required for the first triangle. This will give you a big picture to place
each of the subsequent chapters in. We will conclude by covering the
structure of the Vulkan API and the general usage patterns.

== Origin of Vulkan

Just like the previous graphics APIs, Vulkan is designed as a cross-platform
 abstraction over https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit[GPUs].
The problem with most of these APIs is that the era in which they were
designed featured graphics hardware mostly limited to configurable
fixed functionality. Programmers had to provide the vertex data in a standard
 format and were at the mercy of the GPU manufacturers in regard to
 lighting and shading options.

As graphics card architectures matured, they started offering more and more
programmable functionality. All this new functionality had to be integrated
with the existing APIs somehow. This resulted in less than ideal abstractions
 and a lot of guesswork on the graphics driver side to map the programmer's
 intent to the modern graphics architectures. That's why there are so many
 driver updates for improving the performance in games, sometimes by
 significant margins. Because of the complexity of these drivers, application
  developers also need to deal with inconsistencies between vendors, like
  the syntax that is accepted for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader[shaders].
Aside from these new features, the past decade also saw an influx of mobile
and embedded devices with powerful graphics hardware. These mobile GPUs have
 different architectures based on their energy and space requirements.
One such example is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_rendering[tiled rendering],
which would benefit from improved performance by offering the
programmer more control over this functionality.
Another limitation originating from the age of these APIs is limited
multi-threading support, which can result in a bottleneck on the CPU side.

Vulkan solves these problems by being designed from scratch for modern
graphics architectures. It reduces the driver overhead by allowing programmers to
 clearly specify their intent using a more feature-full yet verbose API, and
 allows multiple threads to create and submit commands in parallel. It reduces
 inconsistencies in shader compilation by switching to a standardized byte
 code format with a single compiler. Lastly, it acknowledges the general
 purpose processing capabilities of modern graphics cards by unifying the
 graphics and compute functionality into a single API.

== What it takes to draw a triangle

We'll now look at an overview of all the steps it takes to render a triangle
 in a well-behaved Vulkan program.
All the concepts introduced here will be elaborated on in the next chapters.
This is just to give you a big picture to relate all the individual components to.

=== Step 1 - Instance and physical device selection

A Vulkan application starts by setting up the Vulkan API through a `VkInstance`.
An instance is created by describing your application and any API extensions
 you will be using. After creating the instance, you can query for Vulkan
 supported hardware and select one or more ``VkPhysicalDevice``s to use for
 operations. You can query for properties like VRAM size and device
 capabilities to select desired devices, for example, to prefer using
 dedicated graphics cards.

For vk::raii we need to use a `vk::raii::Context`, which manages functions that
are not bound to either the `VkInstance` or a `VkPhysicalDevice`

=== Step 2 - Logical device and queue families

After selecting the right hardware device to use, you need to create a
VkDevice (logical device), where you describe more specifically which
VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures you will be using, like multi viewport rendering
and 64-bit floats.
You also need to specify which queue families you would like to use.
Most operations performed with Vulkan, like draw commands and memory
operations, are asynchronously executed by submitting them to a VkQueue.
Queues are allocated from queue families, where each queue family supports a
 specific set of operations in its queues.
For example, there could be separate queue families for graphics, compute
and memory transfer operations.
The availability of queue families could also be used as a distinguishing
factor in physical device selection.
It is possible for a device with Vulkan support to not offer any graphics
functionality; however, all graphics cards with Vulkan support today will
generally support all queue operations that we're interested in.

=== Step 3 - Window surface and swap chain

Unless you're only interested in offscreen rendering, you will need to
create a window to present rendered images.
Windows can be created with the native platform APIs or libraries like
https://www.glfw.org/[GLFW] and https://www.libsdl.org/[SDL].
We will be using GLFW in this tutorial, but more about that in the next
chapter.

We need two more parts to actually render to a window: a window surface
 (VkSurfaceKHR) and a swap chain (VkSwapchainKHR).
Note the `KHR` postfix, which means that these objects are part of a Vulkan
extension. The Vulkan API itself is completely platform-agnostic, which is
why we need to use the standardized WSI (Window System Interface) extension
to interact with the window manager.
The surface is a cross-platform abstraction over windows to render to and is
 generally instantiated by providing a reference to the native window
 handle, for example `HWND` on Windows.
Luckily, the GLFW library has a built-in function to deal with the
platform-specific details of this.

The swap chain is a collection of render targets.
Its basic purpose is to ensure that the image that we're currently rendering
 is different from the one that is currently on the screen.
This is important to make sure that only complete images are shown.
Every time we want to draw a frame, we have to ask the swap chain to provide
us with an image to render to.
When we've finished drawing a frame, the image is returned to the swap chain
 for it to be presented to the screen at some point.
The number of render targets and conditions for presenting finished images
to the screen depends on the present mode.
Common present modes are  double buffering (vsync) and triple buffering.
We'll look into these in the swap chain creation chapter.

Some platforms allow you to render directly to a display without interacting
 with any window manager through the `VK_KHR_display` and
 `VK_KHR_display_swapchain` extensions.
These allow you to create a surface that represents the entire screen and
could be used to implement your own window manager, for example.

=== Step 4 - Image views and framebuffers

To draw to an image acquired from the swap chain, we have to wrap it into a
VkImageView and VkFramebuffer.
An image view references a specific part of an image to be used, and a
framebuffer references image views that are to be used for color, depth and
stencil targets.
Because there could be many different images in the swap chain, we'll
preemptively create an image view and framebuffer for each of them and
select the right one at draw time.

=== Step 5 - Render passes

Render passes in Vulkan describe the type of images that are used during
rendering operations, how they will be used, and how their contents should
be treated.
In our initial triangle rendering application, we'll tell Vulkan that we
will use a single image as a color target and that we want it to be cleared to
 a solid color right before the drawing operation.
Whereas a render pass only describes the type of images, a VkFramebuffer
actually binds specific images to these slots.

=== Step 6 - Graphics pipeline

The graphics pipeline in Vulkan is set up by creating a VkPipeline object.
It describes the configurable state of the graphics card, like the viewport
size and depth buffer operation and the programmable state using VkShaderModule objects.
The VkShaderModule objects are created from shader byte code.
The driver also needs to know which render targets will be used in the
pipeline, which we specify by referencing the render pass.

One of the most distinctive features of Vulkan compared to existing APIs, is
 that almost all configuration of the graphics pipeline needs to be set in
 advance.
That means that if you want to switch to a different shader or slightly
change your vertex layout, then you need to entirely recreate the graphics
pipeline.
That means that you will have to create many VkPipeline objects in advance
for all the different combinations you need for your rendering operations.
Only some basic configuration, like viewport size and clear color, can be
changed dynamically.
All the states also need to be described explicitly; there is no default
color blend state, for example.

The good news is that because you're doing the equivalent of ahead-of-time
compilation versus just-in-time compilation, there are more optimization
opportunities for the driver. Runtime performance is more predictable
because large state changes like switching to a different graphics pipeline
are made very explicit.

=== Step 7 - Command pools and command buffers

As mentioned earlier, many of the operations in Vulkan that we want to
execute, like drawing operations, need to be submitted to a queue.
These operations first need to be recorded into a VkCommandBuffer before
they can be submitted.
These command buffers are allocated from a `VkCommandPool` that is
associated with a specific queue family.
To draw a simple triangle, we need to record a command buffer with the
following operations:

* Begin the render pass
* Bind the graphics pipeline
* Draw three vertices
* End the render pass

Because the image in the framebuffer depends on which specific image the
swap chain will give us, we need to record a command buffer for each
possible image and select the right one at draw time.
The alternative would be to record the command buffer again every frame,
which is not as efficient.

=== Step 8 - Main loop

Now that the drawing commands have been wrapped into a command buffer, the
main loop is quite straightforward.
We first acquire an image from the swap chain with vkAcquireNextImageKHR.
We can then select the appropriate command buffer for that image and execute
 it with vkQueueSubmit.
Finally, we return the image to the swap chain for presentation to the
screen with vkQueuePresentKHR.

Operations that are submitted to queues are executed asynchronously.
Therefore, we have to use synchronization objects like semaphores to ensure a
 correct order of execution.
Execution of the draw command buffer must be set up to wait on image
acquisition to finish; otherwise it may occur that we start rendering to an
image that is still being read for presentation on the screen.
The vkQueuePresentKHR call in turn needs to wait for rendering to be
finished, for which we'll use a second semaphore that is signaled after
rendering completes.

=== Summary

This whirlwind tour should give you a basic understanding of the work ahead
 of drawing the first triangle.
A real-world program contains more steps, like allocating vertex buffers,
creating uniform buffers and uploading texture images that will be covered
in later chapters. However, we'll start simple because Vulkan has enough of
a steep learning curve as it is.
Note that we'll cheat a bit by initially embedding the vertex coordinates in
 the vertex shader instead of using a vertex buffer.
That's because managing vertex buffers requires some familiarity with
command buffers first.

So in short, to draw the first triangle, we need to:

* Create a VkInstance
* Select a supported graphics card (VkPhysicalDevice)
* Create a VkDevice and VkQueue for drawing and presentation
* Create a window, window surface and swap chain
* Wrap the swap chain images into VkImageView
* Create a render pass that specifies the render targets and usage
* Create framebuffers for the render pass
* Set up the graphics pipeline
* Allocate and record a command buffer with the draw commands for every
possible swap chain image
* Draw frames by acquiring images, submitting the right draw command buffer
and returning the images to the swap chain

It's a lot of steps, but the purpose of each step will be made
basic and clear in the upcoming chapters.
If you're confused about the relation of a single step compared to the whole
 program, you should refer back to this chapter.

== API concepts

This chapter will conclude with a short overview of how the Vulkan API is
structured at a lower level.

=== Coding conventions

All the Vulkan functions, enumerations and structs are defined in the
`vulkan.h` header, which is included in the https://lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/[Vulkan SDK]
developed by LunarG. We'll look into installing this SDK in the next chapter.

Functions have a lower case `vk` prefix, types like enumerations and structs
 have a `Vk` prefix and enumeration values have a `VK_` prefix.
The API heavily uses structs to provide parameters to functions.
For example, object creation generally follows this pattern:

[,c++]
----
VkXXXCreateInfo createInfo{};
createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_XXX_CREATE_INFO;
createInfo.pNext = nullptr;
createInfo.foo = ...;
createInfo.bar = ...;

VkXXX object;
if (vkCreateXXX(&createInfo, nullptr, &object) != VK_SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "failed to create object" << std::endl;
    return false;
}
----

Many structures in Vulkan require you to explicitly specify the type of
structure in the `sType` member.
The `pNext` member can point to an extension structure and will always be
`nullptr` in this tutorial.
Functions that create or destroy an object will have a VkAllocationCallbacks
 parameter that allows you to use a custom allocator for driver memory,
 which will also be left `nullptr` in this tutorial.

Almost all functions return a VkResult that is either `VK_SUCCESS` or an
error code.
The specification describes which error codes each function can return and
what they mean.

To help illustrate the utility of using the RAII C++ Vulkan abstraction; this
is the same code written with our modern API:

[,c++]
----
auto createInfo = vk::xxx();
auto object = vk::raii::XXX(context, createInfo);
----

Failure of such calls is reported by C++ exceptions. The exception will
respond with more information about the error including the aforementioned
vkResult, this enables us to check multiple commands from one call and keep
the command syntax clean.

=== Validation layers

As mentioned earlier, Vulkan is designed for high performance and low driver
 overhead.
Therefore, it will include very limited error checking and debugging
capabilities by default.
The driver will often crash instead of returning an error code if you do
something wrong, or worse, it will appear to work on your graphics card and
completely fail on others.

Vulkan allows you to enable extensive checks through a feature known as
_validation layers_.
Validation layers are pieces of code that can be inserted between the API
and the graphics driver to do things like running extra checks on function
parameters and tracking memory management problems.
An important benefit is that you can enable them during development and then
completely disable them when releasing your application for zero overhead.
Anyone can write their own validation layers, but the Vulkan SDK by LunarG
provides a standard set of validation layers that we'll be using in this tutorial.
You also need to register a callback function to receive debug messages from
 the layers.

Because Vulkan is so explicit about every operation and the validation
layers are so extensive, it can actually be a lot easier to find out why
your screen is black compared to OpenGL and Direct3D!

There's only one more step before we'll start writing code, and that's
xref:02_Development_environment.adoc[setting up the development environment].
