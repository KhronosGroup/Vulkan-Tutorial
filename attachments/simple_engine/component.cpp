#include "component.h"
#include "entity.h"

// Most of the Component class implementation is in the header file
// This file is mainly for any methods that need to access the Entity class
// to avoid circular dependencies
//
// This implementation corresponds to the Engine_Architecture chapter in the tutorial:
// https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tutorial/blob/master/en/Building_a_Simple_Engine/Engine_Architecture/03_component_systems.adoc

// No additional implementation needed for now
