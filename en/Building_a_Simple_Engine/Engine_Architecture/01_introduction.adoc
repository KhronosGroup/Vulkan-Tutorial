== Introduction

Welcome to the "Engine Architecture" chapter of our "Building a Simple Game
Engine" series! In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental architectural
patterns and design principles that form the backbone of a modern Vulkan
rendering engine.

While this series focuses primarily on building a rendering engine with Vulkan,
the architectural concepts we'll discuss are applicable to both rendering engines
and full game engines. We'll clarify which patterns are particularly well-suited
for rendering-focused systems versus more general game engine development.

We'll start by taking a step back and considering the overall structure of our engine. A
well-designed architecture is crucial for creating a flexible, maintainable, and extensible rendering system.

=== What You'll Learn

In this chapter, we'll cover:

* *Architectural Patterns* - Common design patterns used in game and rendering engines, including their strengths and trade-offs.

* *Component Systems* - How to implement a flexible component-based architecture that allows for modular and reusable code.

* *Resource Management* - Strategies for efficiently managing and accessing various resources like textures, models, and shaders.

* *Rendering Pipeline* - Designing a flexible rendering pipeline that can accommodate different rendering techniques and effects.

* *Event Systems* - Implementing communication between different parts of your engine through event-driven architecture.

=== Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have completed:

* The main Vulkan tutorial series

You should also be familiar with:

* Object-oriented programming concepts
* Basic design patterns (Observer, Factory, Singleton, etc.)
* Modern C++ features (smart pointers, templates, etc.)

=== Why Architecture Matters

A well-designed engine architecture provides several benefits:

1. *Maintainability* - Clean separation of concerns makes it easier to update and fix individual components without affecting the entire system.

2. *Extensibility* - A modular design allows you to add new features without major refactoring.

3. *Reusability* - Well-encapsulated components can be reused across different projects or parts of the same project.

4. *Performance* - A thoughtful architecture can enable optimizations like multithreading, batching, and caching.

Let's begin our exploration of engine architecture with an overview of common architectural patterns used in modern rendering engines.
