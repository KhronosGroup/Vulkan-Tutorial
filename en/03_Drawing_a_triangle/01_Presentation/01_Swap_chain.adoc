= Swap chain

Vulkan does not have the concept of a "default framebuffer," hence it
requires an infrastructure that will own the buffers we will render to
before we visualize them on the screen. This infrastructure is
known as the *swap chain* and must be created explicitly in Vulkan. The swap
chain is essentially a queue of images that are waiting to be presented to the
screen. Our application will acquire such an image to draw to it, and then
return it to the queue. How exactly the queue works. The conditions for
presenting an image from the queue depend on how the swap chain is set up. However,
the general purpose of the swap chain is to synchronize the presentation of
images with the refresh rate of the screen.

== Checking for swap chain support

Not all graphics cards are capable of presenting images directly to a screen for
various reasons, for example, because they are designed for servers and don't
have any display outputs. Secondly, since image presentation is heavily tied
into the window system and the surfaces associated with windows, it is not
 part of the Vulkan core. You have to enable the `VK_KHR_swapchain`
device extension after querying for its support.

For that purpose we'll first extend the `createLogicalDevice` function to
check if this extension is supported. We've previously seen how to list the
extensions that are supported by a `VkPhysicalDevice`, so doing that should
be fairly straightforward. Note that the Vulkan header file provides a nice
macro `VK_KHR_SWAPCHAIN_EXTENSION_NAME` that is defined as
`VK_KHR_swapchain`. The advantage of using this macro is that the compiler
will catch misspellings.

First declare a list of required device extensions, similar to the list of
validation layers to enable.

[,c++]
----
std::vector<const char*> deviceExtensions = {
    vk::KHRSwapchainExtensionName,
    vk::KHRSpirv14ExtensionName,
    vk::KHRSynchronization2ExtensionName,
    vk::KHRCreateRenderpass2ExtensionName
};
----

It should be noted that the availability of a presentation queue,
as we checked in the previous chapter, implies that the swap chain extension
must be supported. However, the extension does have to be explicitly enabled.

== Enabling device extensions

Using a swapchain requires enabling the `VK_KHR_swapchain` extension first.
Enabling the extension just requires a small change to the logical device
creation structure:

[,c++]
----
deviceCreateInfo.enabledExtensionCount = deviceExtensions.size();
deviceCreateInfo.ppEnabledExtensionNames = deviceExtensions.data();
----

Alternatively, we can do this at the construction and keep this very succinct:

[,c++]
----
std::vector deviceExtensions = { vk::KHRSwapchainExtensionName };
float                     queuePriority = 1.0f;
vk::DeviceQueueCreateInfo deviceQueueCreateInfo( {}, graphicsIndex, 1, &queuePriority );
vk::DeviceCreateInfo      deviceCreateInfo( {}, deviceQueueCreateInfo, {}, deviceExtensions );
----

== Querying details of swap chain support

Just checking if a swap chain is available is not enough because it may not
 be compatible with our window surface. Creating a swap chain also
involves a lot more settings than instance and device creation, so we need to
query for some more details before we're able to proceed.

There are basically three kinds of properties we need to check:

* Basic surface capabilities (min/max number of images in swap chain, min/max
width and height of images)
* Surface formats (pixel format, color space)
* Available presentation modes

This section covers how to query the structs that include this information. The
meaning of these structs and exactly which data they contain is discussed in the
next section.

Let's start with the basic surface capabilities. These properties are
straightforward to query and are returned into a single
`VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR` struct.

[,c++]
----
auto surfaceCapabilities = physicalDevice.getSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR( surface );
----

This function takes the specified `VkPhysicalDevice` and `VkSurfaceKHR` window
surface into account when determining the supported capabilities. All the
support querying functions have these two as first parameters because they are
the core components of the swap chain.

The next step is about querying the supported surface formats.

[,c++]
----
std::vector<vk::SurfaceFormatKHR> availableFormats = physicalDevice.getSurfaceFormatsKHR( surface );
----

Make sure that the vector is resized to hold all the available formats.

Finally, querying the supported presentation modes works exactly the same way
with `vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR`:

[,c++]
----
std::vector<vk::PresentModeKHR> availablePresentModes = physicalDevice.getSurfacePresentModesKHR( surface );
----

All the details are available now. Swap chain support is enough for this
tutorial if there is at least one supported image format and one supported
presentation mode given the window surface we have.
It is important that we only try to query for swap chain support after verifying
that the extension is available.

== Choosing the right settings for the swap chain

There may still be many different modes of varying optimality in the swap
chain. We'll now write a couple of functions to find the right settings for the best
possible swap chain. There are three types of settings to determine:

* Surface format (color depth)
* Presentation mode (conditions for "swapping" images to the screen)
* Swap extent (resolution of images in swapchain)

For each of these settings, we'll have an ideal value in mind that we'll go with
if it's available, and otherwise we'll create some logic to find the next best
thing.

=== Surface format

The function for this setting starts out like this. We'll later pass the
`formats` member of the `SwapChainSupportDetails` struct as argument.

[,c++]
----
vk::SurfaceFormatKHR chooseSwapSurfaceFormat(const std::vector<vk::SurfaceFormatKHR>& availableFormats) {
        return availableFormats[0];
}
----

Each `VkSurfaceFormatKHR` entry contains a `format` and a `colorSpace` member. The
`format` member specifies the color channels and types. For example,
`VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_SRGB` means that we store the B, G, R and alpha channels in
that order with an 8-bit unsigned integer for a total of 32 bits per pixel. The
`colorSpace` member indicates if the SRGB color space is supported or not using
the `VK_COLOR_SPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR` flag. Note that this flag used to be
called `VK_COLORSPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR` in old versions of the specification.

For the color space we'll use SRGB if it is available, because it link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12524623/[results in more accurate perceived colors]. It is also pretty much the standard color space for images, like the textures we'll use later on.
Because of that we should also use an SRGB color format, of which one of the most common ones is `VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_SRGB`.

Let's go through the list and see if the preferred combination is available:

[,c++]
----
for (const auto& availableFormat : availableFormats) {
    if (availableFormat.format == vk::Format::eB8G8R8A8Srgb && availableFormat.colorSpace == vk::ColorSpaceKHR::eSrgbNonlinear) {
        return availableFormat;
    }
}
----

If that also fails, then we could start ranking the available formats based on
how "good" they are, but in most cases it's okay to just settle with the first
format that is specified.

[,c++]
----
vk::SurfaceFormatKHR chooseSwapSurfaceFormat(const std::vector<vk::SurfaceFormatKHR>& availableFormats) {
    for (const auto& availableFormat : availableFormats) {
        if (availableFormat.format == vk::Format::eB8G8R8A8Srgb && availableFormat.colorSpace == vk::ColorSpaceKHR::eSrgbNonlinear) {
            return availableFormat;
        }
    }

    return availableFormats[0];
}
----

=== Presentation mode

The presentation mode is arguably the most important setting for the swap chain,
because it represents the actual conditions for showing images to the screen.
There are four possible modes available in Vulkan:

* `VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR`: Images submitted by your application are
transferred to the screen right away, which may result in tearing.
* `VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR`: The swap chain is a queue where the display takes
an image from the front of the queue when the display is refreshed, and the
program inserts rendered images at the back of the queue. If the queue is full,
then the program has to wait. This is most similar to vertical sync as found in
modern games. The moment that the display is refreshed is known as "vertical
blank".
* `VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR`: This mode only differs from the previous
one if the application is late and the queue was empty at the last vertical
blank. Instead of waiting for the next vertical blank, the image is transferred
right away when it finally arrives. This may result in visible tearing.
* `VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR`: This is another variation of the second mode.
Instead of blocking the application when the queue is full, the images that are
already queued are simply replaced with the newer ones. This mode can be used to
render frames as fast as possible while still avoiding tearing, resulting in
fewer latency issues than standard vertical sync. This is commonly known as
"triple buffering," although the existence of three buffers alone does not
necessarily mean that the framerate is unlocked.

Only the `VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR` mode is guaranteed to be available, so we'll
again have to write a function that looks for the best mode that is available:

[,c++]
----
vk::PresentModeKHR chooseSwapPresentMode(const std::vector<vk::PresentModeKHR>& availablePresentModes) {
    return vk::PresentModeKHR::eFifo;
}
----

I think that `VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR` is a very nice trade-off if
energy usage is not a concern. It allows us to avoid tearing while still
maintaining fairly low latency by rendering new images that are as
up to date as possible right until the vertical blank. On mobile devices,
where energy usage is more important, you will probably want to use
`VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR` instead. Now, let's look through the list to see
if `VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR` is available:

[,c++]
----
vk::PresentModeKHR chooseSwapPresentMode(const std::vector<vk::PresentModeKHR>& availablePresentModes) {
    for (const auto& availablePresentMode : availablePresentModes) {
        if (availablePresentMode == vk::PresentModeKHR::eMailbox) {
            return availablePresentMode;
        }
    }
    return vk::PresentModeKHR::eFifo;
}
----

=== Swap extent

That leaves only one major property, for which we'll add one last function:

[,c++]
----
vk::Extent2D chooseSwapExtent(const vk::SurfaceCapabilitiesKHR& capabilities) {
}
----

The swap extent is the resolution of the swap chain images, and it's almost
always exactly equal to the resolution of the window that we're drawing to _in
pixels_ (more on that in a moment). The range of the possible resolutions is
defined in the `VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR` structure. Vulkan tells us to match
the resolution of the window by setting the width and height in the
`currentExtent` member. However, some window managers do allow us to differ here,
and this is indicated by setting the width and height in `currentExtent` to a
special value: the maximum value of `uint32_t`. In that case we'll pick the
resolution that best matches the window within the `minImageExtent` and
`maxImageExtent` bounds. But we must specify the resolution in the correct unit.

GLFW uses two units when measuring sizes: pixels and
link:https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/intro_guide.html#coordinate_systems[screen coordinates].
For example, the resolution `{WIDTH, HEIGHT}` that we specified earlier when
creating the window is measured in screen coordinates. But Vulkan works with
pixels, so the swap chain extent must be specified in pixels as well.
Unfortunately, if you are using a high DPI display (like Apple's Retina
display), screen coordinates don't correspond to pixels. Instead, due to the
higher pixel density, the resolution of the window in pixel will be larger than
the resolution in screen coordinates. So if Vulkan doesn't fix the swap extent
for us, we can't just use the original `{WIDTH, HEIGHT}`. Instead, we must use
`glfwGetFramebufferSize` to query the resolution of the window in pixel before
matching it against the minimum and maximum image extent.

[,c++]
----
#include <cstdint> // Necessary for uint32_t
#include <limits> // Necessary for std::numeric_limits
#include <algorithm> // Necessary for std::clamp

...

vk::Extent2D chooseSwapExtent(const vk::SurfaceCapabilitiesKHR& capabilities) {
    if (capabilities.currentExtent.width != std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max()) {
        return capabilities.currentExtent;
    }
    int width, height;
    glfwGetFramebufferSize(window, &width, &height);

    return {
        std::clamp<uint32_t>(width, capabilities.minImageExtent.width, capabilities.maxImageExtent.width),
        std::clamp<uint32_t>(height, capabilities.minImageExtent.height, capabilities.maxImageExtent.height)
    };
}
----

The `clamp` function is used here to bound the values of `width` and
`height` between the allowed minimum and maximum extents that are supported
by the implementation.

== Creating the swap chain

Now that we have all of these helper functions helping us with the choices we
have to make at runtime, we finally have all the information necessary to
create a working swap chain.

Create a `createSwapChain` function that starts out with the results of these
calls and make sure to call it from `initVulkan` after logical device creation.

[,c++]
----
void initVulkan() {
    createInstance();
    setupDebugMessenger();
    createSurface();
    pickPhysicalDevice();
    createLogicalDevice();
    createSwapChain();
}

void createSwapChain() {
    auto surfaceCapabilities = physicalDevice.getSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR( surface );
    swapChainSurfaceFormat = chooseSwapSurfaceFormat(physicalDevice.getSurfaceFormatsKHR( surface ));
    swapChainExtent = chooseSwapExtent(surfaceCapabilities);
    auto minImageCount = std::max( 3u, surfaceCapabilities.minImageCount );
    minImageCount = ( surfaceCapabilities.maxImageCount > 0 && minImageCount > surfaceCapabilities.maxImageCount ) ? surfaceCapabilities.maxImageCount : minImageCount;
}
----

Aside from these properties, we also have to decide how many images we
would like to have in the swap chain. The implementation specifies the
minimum number that it requires to function:

[,c++]
----
uint32_t imageCount = surfaceCapabilities.minImageCount;
----

However, simply sticking to this minimum means that we may sometimes have
to wait on the driver to complete internal operations before we can acquire
another image to render to. Therefore, it is recommended to request at least
one more image than the minimum:

[,c++]
----
uint32_t imageCount = surfaceCapabilities.minImageCount + 1;
----

We should also make sure to not exceed the maximum number of images while
doing this, where `0` is a special value that means that there is no maximum:

[,c++]
----
if (surfaceCapabilities.maxImageCount > 0 && imageCount > surfaceCapabilities.maxImageCount) {
    imageCount = surfaceCapabilities.maxImageCount;
}
----

As is tradition with Vulkan objects, creating the swap chain object requires
filling in a large structure, to be fair, the swapchain is a fairly complex
object so it is among the larger createInfo structures in Vulkan:

[,c++]
----
vk::SwapchainCreateInfoKHR swapChainCreateInfo{
    .flags = vk::SwapchainCreateFlagsKHR(), .
    surface = surface, .minImageCount = minImageCount,
    .imageFormat = swapChainSurfaceFormat.format, .imageColorSpace = swapChainSurfaceFormat.colorSpace,
    .imageExtent = swapChainExtent, .imageArrayLayers =1,
    .imageUsage = vk::ImageUsageFlagBits::eColorAttachment, .imageSharingMode = vk::SharingMode::eExclusive,
    .preTransform = surfaceCapabilities.currentTransform, .compositeAlpha = vk::CompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR::eOpaque,
    .presentMode = chooseSwapPresentMode(physicalDevice.getSurfacePresentModesKHR( surface )),
    .clipped = true, .oldSwapchain = nullptr };
----

The `imageArrayLayers` specifies the number of layers each image consists of.
This is always `1` unless you are developing a stereoscopic 3D application. The
`imageUsage` bit field specifies what kind of operations we'll use the images in
the swap chain for. In this tutorial, we're going to render directly to them,
which means that they're used as color attachment. It is also possible that
you'll render images to a separate image first to perform operations like
post-processing. In that case you may use a value like
`VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT` instead and use a memory operation to transfer
the rendered image to a swap chain image.

[,c++]
----
uint32_t queueFamilyIndices[] = {graphicsFamily, presentFamily};

if (graphicsFamily != presentFamily) {
    swapChainCreateInfo.imageSharingMode = vk::SharingMode::eConcurrent;
    swapChainCreateInfo.queueFamilyIndexCount = 2;
    swapChainCreateInfo.pQueueFamilyIndices = queueFamilyIndices;
} else {
    swapChainCreateInfo.imageSharingMode = vk::SharingMode::eExclusive;
    swapChainCreateInfo.queueFamilyIndexCount = 0; // Optional
    swapChainCreateInfo.pQueueFamilyIndices = nullptr; // Optional
}
----

Next, we need to specify how to handle swap chain images that will be used
across multiple queue families. That will be the case in our application if the
graphics queue family is different from the presentation queue. We'll be drawing
on the images in the swap chain from the graphics queue and then submitting them
on the presentation queue. There are two ways to handle images that are
accessed from multiple queues:

* `VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE`: An image is owned by one queue family at a time,
and ownership must be explicitly transferred before using it in another queue
family. This option offers the best performance.
* `VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT`: Images can be used across multiple queue
families without explicit ownership transfers.

If the queue families differ, then we'll be using the concurrent mode in this
tutorial to avoid having to do the ownership chapters, because these involve
some concepts that are better explained at a later time. Concurrent mode
requires you to specify in advance between which queue families ownership will
be shared using the `queueFamilyIndexCount` and `pQueueFamilyIndices`
parameters. If the graphics queue family and presentation queue family are the
same, which will be the case on most hardware, then we should stick to exclusive
mode. Concurrent mode requires you to specify at least two distinct
queue families.

[,c++]
----
swapChainCreateInfo.preTransform = surfaceCapabilities.currentTransform;
----

We can specify that a certain transform should be applied to images in the swap
chain if it is supported (`supportedTransforms` in `capabilities`), like a
90-degree clockwise rotation or horizontal flip. To specify that you do not want
any transformation, simply specify the current transformation.

[,c++]
----
swapChainCreateInfo.compositeAlpha = vk::CompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR::eOpaque;
----

The `compositeAlpha` field specifies if the alpha channel should be used for
blending with other windows in the window system. You'll almost always want to
simply ignore the alpha channel, hence `VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR`.

[,c++]
----
swapChainCreateInfo.presentMode = presentMode;
swapChainCreateInfo.clipped = vk::True;
----

The `presentMode` member speaks for itself. If the `clipped` member is set to
`VK_TRUE` then that means that we don't care about the color of pixels that are
obscured, for example, because another window is in front of them. Unless you
really need to be able to read these pixels back and get predictable results,
you'll get the best performance by enabling clipping.

[,c++]
----
swapChainCreateInfo.oldSwapchain = VK_NULL_HANDLE;
----

That leaves one last field, `oldSwapChain`. With Vulkan, it's possible that
your swap chain becomes invalid or unoptimized while your application is
running, for example, because the window was resized. In that case, the swap chain
actually needs to be recreated from scratch, and a reference to the old one must
be specified in this field. This is a complex topic that we'll learn more about
in xref:03_Drawing_a_triangle/04_Swap_chain_recreation.adoc[a future chapter]. For now, we'll assume that we'll only ever create
one swap chain.

Now add class members to store the `VkSwapchainKHR` object and its images:

[,c++]
----
VkSwapchainKHR swapChain;
std::vector<vk::Image> swapChainImages;
----

Creating the swap chain is now as simple as calling `vkCreateSwapchainKHR`:

[,c++]
----
swapChain = vk::raii::SwapchainKHR( device, swapChainCreateInfo );
swapChainImages = swapChain.getImages();
----

The parameters are the logical device, swap chain creation info, optional custom
allocators and a pointer to the variable to store the handle in.

Now run the application to ensure that the swap chain is created
successfully! If at this point you get an access violation error in
`vkCreateSwapchainKHR` or see a message like `Failed to find
'vkGetInstanceProcAddress' in layer SteamOverlayVulkanLayer.dll`, then see
the xref:90_FAQ.adoc[FAQ entry] about the Steam overlay layer.

Try removing the `swapChainCreateInfo.imageExtent = extent;` line with validation layers
enabled. You'll see that one of the validation layers immediately catches the
mistake and a helpful message is printed:

image::/images/swap_chain_validation_layer.png[]

== Retrieving the swap chain images
The swap chain has been created now, so all that remains is retrieving the
handles of the `VkImage` objects it contains. We'll reference these during rendering
operations in later chapters.

[,c++]
----
std::vector<vk::Image> swapChainImages = swapChainImages = swapChain->getImages();
----

One last thing, store the format and extent we've chosen for the swap chain
images in member variables. We'll need them in future chapters.

[,c++]
----
vk::raii::SwapchainKHR swapChain = nullptr;
std::vector<vk::Image> swapChainImages;
vk::Format swapChainImageFormat = vk::Format::eUndefined;
vk::Extent2D swapChainExtent;

...

swapChainImageFormat = surfaceFormat.format;
swapChainExtent = extent;
----

We now have a set of images that can be drawn onto and can be presented to the
window. The xref:./02_Image_views.adoc[next chapter] will begin to cover how we can set up the images as
render targets, and then we start looking into the actual graphics pipeline and
drawing commands!
