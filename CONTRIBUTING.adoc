== Technical background

Before contributing, make sure you read through these to understand how the tutorial works and why it's structured the way it is.

=== Antora site generator

The tutorial is meant to be rendered as part of the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Site[Vulkan Documentation Project site]. That project makes use of link:https://antora.org/[Antora], a multi-repository documentation site generator.

As such the tutorial is not meant to work or be viewed outside of that documentation site. That means things that may seem broken in e.g. github's preview (like missing images) are fine due to how Antora works.

Any change or fix needs to consider this and make sure that it follows Antora's requirements. This is relevant for the content as well as the structure (see link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/standard-directories/[Antora standard directories]). So if you e.g. want to add screenshots, they need to go into that folder structure.

=== Markup format

The content's of the tutorial are written in Asciidoc (adoc file extension). New content or changes to existing content need comply with this format. If you are new to Asciidoc, the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/asciidoc/asciidoc/[Antora's Asciidoc primer] is a good starting point.

Similar to other markdown languages, most development environments support live preview for Asciidoc. For Visual Studio Code, link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode[this extension] is recommended. It's advised to set the `asciidoc.preview.useEditorStyle` extension setting to `false` to get a preview look similar to the Antora site and also enable the extension's `asciidoc.antora.enableAntoraSupport` option.


=== ClangFormat

To ensure a consistent code style, we use a link:https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html[ClangFormat] definition file. If you make changes to source code, make sure that file is used by your IDE or manually apply ClangFormat to the files you have changed.
