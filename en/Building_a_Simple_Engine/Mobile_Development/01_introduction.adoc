= Mobile Development: Introduction

== Introduction to Mobile Development

In previous chapters, we've built a solid foundation for our simple engine, implementing core components like the rendering pipeline, camera systems, model loading, essential subsystems, and tooling. Now, we're ready to explore how to adapt our engine for mobile platforms, specifically Android and iOS.

Mobile development presents unique challenges and opportunities for Vulkan applications. The constraints of mobile hardware—limited power, memory, and thermal capacity—require careful optimization and consideration of platform-specific features. At the same time, mobile platforms offer exciting possibilities for reaching a wider audience with your applications.

=== What We'll Cover

This chapter will guide you through the complex landscape of mobile Vulkan development, where desktop assumptions often don't apply. We'll start by examining the platform-specific requirements of Android and iOS, which present unique challenges in setup, lifecycle management, and input handling. Mobile applications face constraints that desktop applications rarely encounter—sudden interruptions, battery concerns, and varying hardware capabilities all require careful consideration in your engine design.

Performance optimization takes on critical importance in mobile environments where every watt of power consumption and every millisecond of frame time affects user experience. We'll explore essential techniques like efficient texture formats, along with mobile-specific optimizations that can mean the difference between smooth performance and user frustration.

Understanding the fundamental architectural differences between mobile and desktop GPUs becomes essential for effective optimization. We'll compare Tile-Based Rendering (TBR) and Immediate Mode Rendering (IMR) approaches, helping you understand why techniques that work well on desktop might perform poorly on mobile, and how to design rendering strategies that leverage mobile GPU strengths.

Finally, we'll explore the Vulkan extensions specifically designed for mobile platforms. Extensions like VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read, VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering, and VK_EXT_shader_tile_image unlock performance opportunities that can dramatically improve your application's efficiency on mobile hardware, transforming acceptable performance into exceptional user experiences.

=== Prerequisites

This chapter represents the culmination of everything we've built throughout the previous chapters, as mobile development requires deep integration with all engine systems. You'll need solid mastery of Vulkan fundamentals and the engine architecture we've developed, since mobile optimization often requires fine-tuning at every level—from resource management and rendering pipelines to memory allocation and synchronization.

Modern C++ expertise becomes particularly valuable in mobile development, where performance constraints demand efficient code and careful resource management. C++17 and C++20 features like constexpr, structured bindings, and concepts help create mobile-optimized code that performs well under strict power and thermal limitations.

Understanding basic mobile development concepts will provide crucial context for the platform-specific decisions we'll make. Mobile applications operate under constraints that desktop applications rarely face—app lifecycle events, varying screen densities, touch input paradigms, and the need to preserve battery life all influence how we design and implement our Vulkan engine for mobile platforms.
