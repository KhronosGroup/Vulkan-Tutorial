= Android Project for Vulkan Game Engine Tutorial

This Android project allows you to run the Game Engine's example code in Android.
It demonstrates how to manage a non-trivial project across Desktop and mobile environments from the same code base.

== Project Overview

The Vulkan Game Engine Tutorial is a comprehensive learning project that showcases modern graphics programming using the Vulkan API.
This Android port enables running the same engine code on mobile devices, demonstrating cross-platform development practices.

== Prerequisites

* Android Studio 4.2 or higher
* Android NDK r21 or higher
* CMake 3.10+
* Vulkan SDK
* Android device with Vulkan support (Android 7.0+)

== Building and Running

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle files
3. Build the project
4. Run on your Android device or emulator

== Project Structure

* `app/` - Android-specific code and resources
* `src/` - Shared C++ engine code
* `assets/` - Shared game assets and shaders (automatically copied by Gradle)
** `models/` - GLTF/GLB model files
** `shaders/` - Compiled SPIR-V shader files
** `textures/` - Texture assets
* `CMake/` - Build configuration files

== Asset Management

The project uses Gradle to automatically handle asset deployment.
Place your assets in the following source locations:

* Source assets location: `<project_root>/assets/`
* Gradle will automatically copy assets to: `app/src/main/assets/`
* Asset changes will be synchronized during build

== Key Components

* GLTF model loading support
* Cross-platform rendering pipeline
* JSON configuration using nlohmann_json
* Unified asset management system with Gradle automation

The project demonstrates professional-grade techniques for maintaining a single codebase that targets both desktop and mobile platforms while leveraging modern C++20 features and Vulkan's cross-platform capabilities.
