= Camera & Transformations: Transformation Matrices

== Transformation Matrices

In this section, we'll dive deeper into the transformation matrices used in 3D graphics and how they're applied in our rendering pipeline.

=== The Model-View-Projection (MVP) Pipeline

The transformation of vertices from object space to screen space involves a series of matrix multiplications, commonly known as the MVP pipeline:

[source,cpp]
----
// The complete transformation pipeline
glm::mat4 MVP = projectionMatrix * viewMatrix * modelMatrix;
----

Let's explore each of these matrices in detail.

=== Model Matrix

The model matrix transforms vertices from object space to world space. It positions, rotates, and scales objects in the world.

[source,cpp]
----
glm::mat4 createModelMatrix(
    const glm::vec3& position,
    const glm::vec3& rotation,
    const glm::vec3& scale
) {
    // Start with identity matrix
    glm::mat4 model = glm::mat4(1.0f);

    // Apply transformations in order: scale, rotate, translate
    model = glm::translate(model, position);

    // Apply rotations around each axis
    model = glm::rotate(model, glm::radians(rotation.x), glm::vec3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
    model = glm::rotate(model, glm::radians(rotation.y), glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));
    model = glm::rotate(model, glm::radians(rotation.z), glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));

    // Apply scaling
    model = glm::scale(model, scale);

    return model;
}
----

=== View Matrix

The view matrix transforms vertices from world space to view space (camera space). It represents the position and orientation of the camera.

[source,cpp]
----
glm::mat4 createViewMatrix(
    const glm::vec3& cameraPosition,
    const glm::vec3& cameraTarget,
    const glm::vec3& upVector
) {
    return glm::lookAt(cameraPosition, cameraTarget, upVector);
}
----

The `lookAt` function creates a view matrix that positions the camera at `cameraPosition`, looking at `cameraTarget`, with `upVector` defining the up direction.

=== Projection Matrix

The projection matrix transforms vertices from view space to clip space. It defines how 3D coordinates are projected onto the 2D screen.

==== Perspective Projection

Perspective projection simulates how objects appear smaller as they get farther away, which is how our eyes naturally perceive the world.

[source,cpp]
----
glm::mat4 createPerspectiveMatrix(
    float fovY,
    float aspectRatio,
    float nearPlane,
    float farPlane
) {
    return glm::perspective(glm::radians(fovY), aspectRatio, nearPlane, farPlane);
}
----

Parameters:

* `fovY`: Field of view angle in degrees (vertical)
* `aspectRatio`: Width divided by height of the viewport
* `nearPlane`: Distance to the near clipping plane
* `farPlane`: Distance to the far clipping plane

==== Orthographic Projection

Orthographic projection doesn't have perspective distortion, making it useful for 2D rendering or technical drawings.

[source,cpp]
----
glm::mat4 createOrthographicMatrix(
    float left,
    float right,
    float bottom,
    float top,
    float nearPlane,
    float farPlane
) {
    return glm::ortho(left, right, bottom, top, nearPlane, farPlane);
}
----

=== Normal Matrix

When applying non-uniform scaling to objects, normals can become incorrect if transformed with the model matrix. The normal matrix solves this issue:

[source,cpp]
----
glm::mat3 createNormalMatrix(const glm::mat4& modelMatrix) {
    // The normal matrix is the transpose of the inverse of the upper-left 3x3 part of the model matrix
    return glm::transpose(glm::inverse(glm::mat3(modelMatrix)));
}
----

=== Applying Transformations in Shaders

In Vulkan, we typically pass these matrices to our shaders as uniform variables:

[source,glsl]
----
// Vertex shader
#version 450

layout(binding = 0) uniform UniformBufferObject {
    mat4 model;
    mat4 view;
    mat4 proj;
} ubo;

layout(location = 0) in vec3 inPosition;
layout(location = 1) in vec3 inNormal;
layout(location = 2) in vec2 inTexCoord;

layout(location = 0) out vec3 fragNormal;
layout(location = 1) out vec2 fragTexCoord;

void main() {
    // Apply MVP transformation
    gl_Position = ubo.proj * ubo.view * ubo.model * vec4(inPosition, 1.0);

    // Transform normal using normal matrix
    mat3 normalMatrix = transpose(inverse(mat3(ubo.model)));
    fragNormal = normalMatrix * inNormal;

    fragTexCoord = inTexCoord;
}
----

=== Hierarchical Transformations

For complex objects or scenes with parent-child relationships, we use hierarchical transformations:

[source,cpp]
----
// Parent transformation
glm::mat4 parentModel = createModelMatrix(parentPosition, parentRotation, parentScale);

// Child transformation relative to parent
glm::mat4 localModel = createModelMatrix(childLocalPosition, childLocalRotation, childLocalScale);

// Combined transformation
glm::mat4 childWorldModel = parentModel * localModel;
----

In the next section, we'll implement a camera system that uses these transformation concepts to navigate our 3D scenes.
