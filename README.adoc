== About

This repository hosts the contents of the link:https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest[Khronos Vulkan Tutorial]. The tutorial is part of the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Site[Vulkan Documentation Project].

== Differences

Compared to the original tutorial, this version of the tutorial is teaching up-to-date concepts:

* Vulkan 1.4 as a baseline
* Dynamic rendering instead of render passes
* Timeline semaphores
* link:https://shader-slang.org/[Slang] as the primary shading language
* Modern C++ (20) with modules
* link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp[Vulkan-Hpp] with link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization[RAII]

It also contains Vulkan usage clarifications, improved synchronization and new content.

== Project Structure

The repository is organized into several important directories:

* `en/` - Contains the tutorial content in English, organized by chapters
** The main tutorial covers fundamental Vulkan concepts (chapters 00-17)
** The "Building a Simple Engine" section builds upon these fundamentals to create a structured rendering engine
* `attachments/` - Contains code examples, shader files, and resources used in the tutorial
* `images/` - Contains illustrations, diagrams, and screenshots used in the tutorial
* `scripts/` - Contains utility scripts, including dependency installation scripts
* `antora/` - Contains configuration files for the Antora documentation system

== Installation Dependencies

The project provides scripts to help you install the necessary dependencies:

=== Linux
Run the following command to install dependencies on Linux:
[source,bash]
----
./scripts/install_dependencies_linux.sh
----

This script detects your package manager (apt, dnf, pacman) and installs the required dependencies, including:
* Build essentials (gcc, cmake, ninja-build)
* GLFW, GLM, tinyobjloader, stb
* X Window System dependencies

It also provides instructions for installing the Vulkan SDK.

=== Windows
Run the following command to install dependencies on Windows:
[source,batch]
----
scripts\install_dependencies_windows.bat
----

This script uses vcpkg to install the required dependencies, including:
* GLFW, GLM, tinyobjloader, stb

You will also need to install the Vulkan SDK separately from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/.
