= Logical device and queues

== Introduction

After selecting a physical device to use, we need to set up a *logical device* to
interface with it. The logical device creation process is similar to the
instance creation process and describes the features we want to use. We also
need to specify which queues to create now that we've queried which queue
families are available. You can even create multiple logical devices from the
same physical device if you have varying requirements.

Start by adding a new class member to store the logical device handle in.

[,c++]
----
vk::raii::Device device;
----

Next, add a `createLogicalDevice` function that is called from `initVulkan`.

[,c++]
----
void initVulkan() {
    createInstance();
    setupDebugMessenger();
    pickPhysicalDevice();
    createLogicalDevice();
}

void createLogicalDevice() {

}
----

== Specifying the queues to be created

The creation of a logical device involves specifying a bunch of details in
structs again, of which the first one will be `VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo`. This
structure describes the number of queues we want for a single queue family.
Right now we're only interested in a queue with graphics capabilities.

[,c++]
----
std::vector<vk::QueueFamilyProperties> queueFamilyProperties = physicalDevice.getQueueFamilyProperties();

vk::DeviceQueueCreateInfo deviceQueueCreateInfo { .queueFamilyIndex = graphicsIndex };
----

The currently available drivers will only allow you to create a small number of
queues for each queue family, and you don't really need more than one. That's
because you can create all the command buffers on multiple threads and then
submit them all at once on the main thread with a single low-overhead call.

Vulkan lets you assign priorities to queues to influence the scheduling of
command buffer execution using floating point numbers between `0.0` and `1.0`.
This is required even if there is only a single queue:

[,c++]
----
float queuePriority = 1.0f;
vk::DeviceQueueCreateInfo deviceQueueCreateInfo { .queueFamilyIndex = graphicsIndex, .queueCount = 1, .pQueuePriorities = &queuePriority };
----

== Specifying used device features

The next information to specify is the set of device features that we'll be
using. These are the features that we queried support for with
`vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures` in the previous chapter, like geometry shaders.
Right now we don't need anything special, so we can simply define it and leave
everything to `VK_FALSE`. We'll come back to this structure once we're about to
start doing more interesting things with Vulkan.

[,c++]
----
vk::PhysicalDeviceFeatures deviceFeatures;
----

== Enabling additional device features

Vulkan is designed to be backwards compatible, which means that by default, you only get access to the basic features that were available in Vulkan 1.0. To use newer features, you need to explicitly request them during device creation.

In Vulkan, features are organized into different structures based on when they were introduced or what functionality they relate to. For example:
- Basic features are in `vk::PhysicalDeviceFeatures`
- Vulkan 1.3 features are in `vk::PhysicalDeviceVulkan13Features`
- Extension-specific features are in their own structures (like `vk::PhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicStateFeaturesEXT`)

To enable multiple sets of features, Vulkan uses a concept called "structure chaining." Each feature structure has a `pNext` field that can point to another structure, creating a chain of feature requests.

The C++ Vulkan API provides a helper template called `vk::StructureChain` that makes this process easier. Let's see how to use it:

[,c++]
----
// Create a chain of feature structures
vk::StructureChain<vk::PhysicalDeviceFeatures2, vk::PhysicalDeviceVulkan13Features, vk::PhysicalDeviceExtendedDynamicStateFeaturesEXT> featureChain = {
    {},                               // vk::PhysicalDeviceFeatures2 (empty for now)
    {.dynamicRendering = true },      // Enable dynamic rendering from Vulkan 1.3
    {.extendedDynamicState = true }   // Enable extended dynamic state from the extension
};
----

Here's what's happening in this code:

1. We create a `vk::StructureChain` with three different feature structures.
2. For each structure in the chain, we provide an initializer:
   - The first structure (`vk::PhysicalDeviceFeatures2`) is left empty with `{}`
   - In the second structure, we enable the `dynamicRendering` feature from Vulkan 1.3
   - In the third structure, we enable the `extendedDynamicState` feature from an extension

The `vk::StructureChain` template automatically connects these structures together by setting up the `pNext` pointers between them. This saves us from having to manually link each structure to the next one.

When we create the logical device later, we'll pass a pointer to the first structure in this chain, which will allow Vulkan to see all the features we want to enable.

== Specifying device extensions

For our application to work properly, we need to enable certain device extensions. These extensions provide additional functionality that we'll need later in the tutorial.

[,c++]
----
std::vector<const char*> deviceExtensions = {
    vk::KHRSwapchainExtensionName,
    vk::KHRSpirv14ExtensionName,
    vk::KHRSynchronization2ExtensionName,
    vk::KHRCreateRenderpass2ExtensionName
};
----

The `VK_KHR_swapchain` extension is required for presenting rendered images to the window. The other extensions provide additional functionality that we'll use in later parts of the tutorial.

== Creating the logical device

With all the necessary information prepared, we can now create the logical device. We need to fill in the `vk::DeviceCreateInfo` structure and connect our feature chain to it:

[,c++]
----
vk::DeviceCreateInfo deviceCreateInfo{
    .pNext = &featureChain.get<vk::PhysicalDeviceFeatures2>(),
    .queueCreateInfoCount = 1,
    .pQueueCreateInfos = &deviceQueueCreateInfo,
    .enabledExtensionCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(deviceExtensions.size()),
    .ppEnabledExtensionNames = deviceExtensions.data()
};
----

Reviewing how we connect our feature chain to the device creation process:

1. The `featureChain.get<vk::PhysicalDeviceFeatures2>()` method retrieves a reference to the first structure in our chain (the `vk::PhysicalDeviceFeatures2` structure).

2. We assign this reference to the `pNext` field of the `deviceCreateInfo` structure.

3. Since all the structures in our feature chain are already connected (thanks to `vk::StructureChain`), Vulkan will be able to see all the features we want to enable by following the chain of `pNext` pointers.

This approach allows us to request multiple sets of features in a clean and organized way. Vulkan will process each structure in the chain and enable the requested features during device creation.

The remainder of the information bears a resemblance to the
`VkInstanceCreateInfo` struct and requires you to specify extensions and
validation layers. The difference is that these are device-specific this time.

An example of a device-specific extension is `VK_KHR_swapchain`, which allows
you to present rendered images from that device to windows. It is possible that
there are Vulkan devices in the system that lack this ability, for example,
because they only support compute operations. We will come back to this
extension in the swap chain chapter.

Previous implementations of Vulkan made a distinction between instance and
device-specific validation layers, but this is
link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/chap40.html#extendingvulkan-layers-devicelayerdeprecation[no longer the case].
That means that the `enabledLayerCount` and `ppEnabledLayerNames` fields of
`VkDeviceCreateInfo` are ignored by up-to-date implementations.

As mentioned earlier, we need several device-specific extensions for our application to work properly.

[,c++]
----
device = vk::raii::Device( physicalDevice, deviceCreateInfo );
----

The parameters are the physical device to interface with, and the usage
info we just specified, the optional allocation callbacks pointer and a pointer
to a variable to store the logical device handle in. Similarly to the instance
creation function, this call can throw errors based on enabling non-existent
extensions or specifying the desired usage of unsupported features.

Logical devices don't interact directly with instances, which is why it's not
included as a parameter.

== Retrieving queue handles

The queues are automatically created along with the logical device, but we don't have a handle to interface with them yet.
First, add a class member to store a handle to the graphics queue:

[,c++]
----
vk::raii::Queue graphicsQueue;
----

Device queues are implicitly cleaned up when the device is destroyed, so we
don't need to do anything in `cleanup`.

We can use the `vkGetDeviceQueue` function to retrieve queue handles for each
queue family. The parameters are the logical device, queue family, queue index
and a pointer to the variable to store the queue handle in. Because we're only
creating a single queue from this family, we'll simply use index `0`.

[,c++]
----
graphicsQueue = vk::raii::Queue( device, graphicsIndex, 0 );
----

With the logical device and queue handles, we can now actually start using the
graphics card to do things! In the
xref:/03_Drawing_a_triangle/01_Presentation/00_Window_surface.adoc[next few chapters], we'll set
 up the resources to present results to the window system.
